However, as your app UI becomes more complex, you will find it more difficult to define the layout constraints that apply perfectly for all iOS devices.
This is one of the reasons why Apple introduces Stack views in the latest version of Xcode and iOS (> 9.0).

You can embed multiple UI objects into one by using stack views.
Best of all, for views embedded in a stack view, you no longer need to define auto layout constraints.

In each Xcode project, it includes an asset catalog (i.e. Assets.xcassets) for managing images and icons that are used by your app.

As a sidenote, if you have any problem selecting the stack view, you can hold the Shift key and right click the stack view.
Interface Builder will then show you a shortcut menu for selection.

Apple's engineers recommended developers to adopt stack views first, and then only when you need to actually use raw constraints.
